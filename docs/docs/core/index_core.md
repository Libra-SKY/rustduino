*Okay so here we go*

---

These are the things which have implemented in our library. These features interact directly with the Arduino Board Hardware and implement some of the basic work to get other purposeful things done.
We have the following implementations in our **HAL (Hardware Abstraction Library)**

- [Interrupts](interrupts.md)
- [WatchDog](watchdog.md)
- [Global Power Control](sleep_mode.md)
- [Peripheral Power Control](power.md)
- [Input-Output Ports](port.md)
- [Shift Register Control](shift.md)

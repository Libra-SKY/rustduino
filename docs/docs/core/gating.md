The SIM(System Integration Module) is another piece of hardware we need for our
microcontroller setup. Here, we use a SIM to enable the appropriate clock gate
to enable our I/O port.

## Function definitions
----

- Structure Sim represents a block of memory using structures representing
  registers in SIM.

```rust
pub struct Sim {/* fields omitted */}
```

- Helper enum containing register definiton to control clock gating for
  different ports

```rust
pub enum Clock {/*feilds ommited/*}
```

## Implementations
----

### - Impl `new`

```rust
pub fn new() -> &'static mut Sim
```

Return a struct containing register definition of the Sim.

### - Impl `enable_clock` for `Sim`

```rust
pub fn enable_clock(&mut self, clock: Clock)
```

Enable clock gate by changing the corresponding memory location.

_High performance and memory safety; who doesn't want that?_

----

* **High performance**: Rust is blazing fast and memory-efficient without runtime or garbage collection. Embedded devices are low-resource devices and cannot handle heavy runtime and garbage collection. Rust helps us write fast and efficient programs making it an excellent choice for embedded programming.

* **Safety**: Embedded devices are mission-critical and must perform correctly and must not perform incorrectly. Well, you don't want your toaster to behave like a vacuum cleaner. Rust’s rich type-system and ownership model guarantees memory safety and thread safety, both of which are essential for a program to function correctly.

* **Powerful static analysis**: Rust’s type system prevents data races at compile time. The type system can also be used to check other properties at compile-time; reducing the need for checks at runtime in some cases. When applied to embedded programs these static checks can be used, for example, to enforce that configuration of I/O is done properly. The ownership model can be used to ensure that only certain parts of a program can modify a peripheral.

* **Fearless concurrency**: Simply put concurrency is the ability of different parts of a program to be executed at the same time or out of order. In an embedded context, this includes:

  * interrupt handlers,
  * multi-threading,
  * multiple-core microprocessors.

  Since many embedded systems have to deal with interrupts, concurrency will come up sooner or later, and it’s where many subtle and difficult bugs can occur. Rust provides several abstractions and safety guarantees that help us write correct code.

* **Portability**: In embedded environments portability is an important topic. Every vendor and even each family from a single manufacturer offers different capabilities and similarly, the ways to interact with peripherals will vary. A common way to deal with this is by building Hardware Abstraction Layers (HALs).
